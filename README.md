### *the_grode* 😎  • Software engineer
- 👋 Hi, I'm [**@Gray-Mafutala**](https://github.com/Gray-Mafutala/), a passionate of hacking and coding in general.
- 🏁 I tried a lot of programming languages in the past and tested some technologies like C/C++, Java, Delphi, Python and Tensorflow for deeplearning, C# with Unity for video game creation, I could go on like this until the stack overflows 😜
- 🌱 I am currently taking certifications to improve my skills in ***front-end development*** (HTML/CSS, Sass, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux and others), so I push my achievements sometimes, do not hesitate to see it and tell me what you think 😁
- ⚡ In the near future, I plan to join a team of web development, or work in freelancing.
- 📫 Need to contact me? Join me on twitter [@MafutalaG](https://twitter.com/MafutalaG) or leave me a message at graymafutala@gmail.com

By the way, for those who are wondering, Gray + Code = Grode, that's why I'm The Grode :))
